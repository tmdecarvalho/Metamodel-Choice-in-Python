INCLUDED: code for the case study in the publication done in Python. 
NOTE: I have tried to follow the original code as much as possible, but the results will be different for the more complex models, due to different random number generators. 
In particular, ANN model used here yields different results, due to different fine-tuning defaults and other package differences compared to its R counterpart.
